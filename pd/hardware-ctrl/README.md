# hardware-ctrl

So far I have been experimenting with controlling, via MIDI, hardware drums from puredata using a modular approach with basic euclidean sequencing.

The intention is to have a touchosc interface for each project.

## projects
- tr6s-sequencer: euclidean sequencer for roland tr-6s
- tr8s-sequencer: euclidean sequencer for roland tr-8s
- drm1mk3-sequencer: euclidean seq for vermona DRM1-mk3
- nord3p-sequencer: euclidean sequencer for nord drum 3p
- nord3p-sequencer-sc: same as above but with separate clock per channel.
